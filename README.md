## Documentation
Docs are still WIP, also have to fix and improve lot of stuff and right now I am working on CLI part

For now you can just play with /content folder where future website content is managed using markdown. Inspired by Jekyll btw :)
Use cargo run to build and you will get /dist folder where final website with html produces.
